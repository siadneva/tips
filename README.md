Tips Calculator

This is an IOS application for calculating tips

Time spent: 5 hours spent in total

Completed user stories:

 Required: User can input a bill amount, select tip percentage, dismiss the keyboard. The total amount to pay is calculated and displayed based on the input
 Optional: Added app icon; added images next to the layout; changed font family and color
 
Notes:

I had some trouble with xcode layout at first (switching between various views). Sometimes I would get two code editors (instead of the code and storyboard view), and the code wasn't identical in those views, which was confusing.
