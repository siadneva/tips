Tips Calculator

This is an IOS application for calculating tips

Time spent: about 5 hours. 

Completed user stories:

 Required: User can input a bill amount, select tip percentage, dismiss the keyboard. The total amount to pay is calculated and displayed based on the input
 Optional: Added app icon; changed font family and color; added images next to the layout; included animation/fade for those images (as user inputs amount)
 
Notes:

I had some trouble with xcode (like switching between various views/parts).
